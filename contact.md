My GitHub username is [TerrorJack](https://github.com/TerrorJack). You can also ping terrorjack on Reddit or `#haskell`/`#ghc` on Freenode, but expect latency to be counted in days.

If you happen to be around in Beijing, you're welcome to drop me an email, I'd be happy to buy you a beer and chat about anything :)
