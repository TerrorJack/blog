Hi there.

My name is Shao Cheng. I am a late stage Haskell addict, currently based in Beijing and working for [Tweag I/O](https://tweag.io).

## CS Stuff

I'm a hobbyist of programming languages: the first principles behind them, and their implementation. A major career goal of my own is to write a full-fledged compiler that contains innovation and has real commercial users.

My current comfort zone is Haskell. It is a sweet spot in the universe of typed functional programming: being an active research front, but not tied to the ivory tower, since its ecosystem is already suitable for a lot of real-world development tasks.

## Projects

I'm working full-time on a Haskell-to-WebAssembly compiler named [`asterius`](https://github.com/tweag/asterius). It launched in early 2018, and is already capable of compiling & running some non-trivial Haskell programs. There's also an HIW'18 [lightening talk](https://icfp18.sigplan.org/event/hiw-2018-papers-asterius-bringing-haskell-to-webassembly) about it.

There are also some other hobby projects which can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/TerrorJack) account. All of my projects are licensed under the 3-clause BSD license.
